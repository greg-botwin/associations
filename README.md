## Purpose
The purpose of this Shiny application is to interactively and quickly review previosuly found associations identified by the Cedars-Sinai F. Widjaja Foundation Inflammatory Bowel and Immunobiology Research Institute.

## Functionality
### Search
Users can search associations by Gene (e.g. NOD2), position (e.g. Chr. 16, between 50731050-50766987), or by RS ID (e.g. rs5743293). Searching by position queries by the position of the SNP not by the position of the Gene. 

Users can search by multiple Genes or SNPs at a time by selecting multiple Genes or SNPs respectively. If a user has a large list of Genes or SNPs they can copy and paste them into the search box but the Genes/SNPs must be in comma seperated format e.g. (IL1,IL2,IL3,IL4,IL5,IL6,IL7,IL8,IL9,IL10).

### Filtering
Users can filter their query to only include SNP associations that reach user defined thresholds. Users can filter by 
1. P Value
2. Minor Allele Frequency
3.
